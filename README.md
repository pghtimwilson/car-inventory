# car-inventory

## Getting Started

### Backend

To run the backend, open the car-inventory-backend.sln file located here in the root folder.
Currently it is configured to be used from IIS Express (https://localhost:44320/api).

Note: The backend will generate a random inventory with each running of the application. 
The Inventory is not being persisted and is only saved in memory.

### Frontend

The frontend was developed in React, I am somewhat new to React but it is currently what I am developing in.
I cannot say that I am very happy with the 3rd party components I chose for the UI (grid, react-bootstrap).

1. npm-install from the .\car-inventory-frontend\ directory
2. npm-start from the .\car-inventory-frontend\ directory

## Note

There are definitely areas of improvement...
